Supervisor
==========

Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to
control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Supervisor has been tested and is known to run on Linux (Ubuntu), Mac OS X
(10.4, 10.5, 10.6), and Solaris (10 for Intel) and FreeBSD 6.1.  It will
likely work fine on most UNIX systems.

This version has been forked from the main supervisor repository <https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/labels/python%203>`_.  It was forked for purposes
of packaging for use with lorax.  It has been verified to run under Python 3
in that limited context and is being used in a production setting.
